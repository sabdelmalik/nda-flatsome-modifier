# nda-flatsome-modifier
I wanted to use my own "Efffects" as background for the Banners. There I needed to load my own css after Flatsome's effects.css has loaded. 

To ensure that, in this plugin, nda-flatsome-modifier-public.css is loaded when the wp_footer action is invoked.

Currently I don't have a way to add to, or change the list of effect in Flasome panel, so, I used two that I did not want: snow & sliding-glass.

Because this plugin just loads a css file, I added a style to hide the price range filter and the ordering option on the product pages.
